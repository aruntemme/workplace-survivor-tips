## The Stats (Music Parody Focus)

### Stat 1: The Manager Track
```
Your manager played you more
than Spotify played your top artist.

Times "looped in": 247
Times your input mattered: 3

You were basically on repeat.
```

### Stat 2: The Playlist Comparison
```
Your meeting calendar looks like
a sad 10-hour playlist.

Top genres:
1. "Quick Syncs" (never quick)
2. "Let's Align" (never aligned)
3. "Touch Base" (never touched anything productive)
```

### Stat 3: The Skip Rate
```
If emails were songs, your skip rate
would be 94%.

Emails received: 12,847
Emails actually read: 847
Emails that deserved attention: 12
```

### Stat 4: The On Repeat
```
Things you said on repeat this year:

"Sounds good" × 847
"Let me check my calendar" × 234
"I'll circle back" × 189
"Sorry, I was on mute" × 156

Your most-played phrase:
"Sure, I can take that on"
(You couldn't. You did anyway.)
```

### Stat 5: The Listening Time
```
Your total time in meetings: 847 hours

That's the equivalent of listening to
"Bohemian Rhapsody" 8,470 times.

Except way less enjoyable.
```

### Stat 6: The Top Artists
```
People who took the most of your time:

1. Your Manager (347 hours)
2. That One Coworker (189 hours)
3. "All Hands" (156 hours)
4. Your Own Anxiety (∞ hours)

Your manager was your Top Artist.
You didn't choose this playlist.
```

### Stat 7: The Genre
```
Your work year genre was:

✦ CORPORATE ELEVATOR MUSIC ✦

Endless. Repetitive.
Makes you feel nothing.
```

## Persona Results (Music Edition)

### The Chart-Topper
**"You're Actually Thriving"**
```
Your 2024 was a platinum record.

You somehow made corporate
work for you. Your energy is
unmatched. Your positivity is
either genuine or terrifying.

Top Track: "I Love Mondays" (Unironic Mix)

Share this flex. We dare you.
```

### The One-Hit Wonder
**"You Had a Moment"**
```
You peaked somewhere around Q2.
Then slowly faded from the charts.

By Q4, you were playing the hits
(doing the minimum that worked before)
and hoping no one noticed.

Top Track: "Remember When I Cared?"

It's okay. Most years are like this.
```

### The B-Side
**"You're the Hidden Track"**
```
Nobody knows what you actually do.
Including, sometimes, you.

You showed up. You did...things.
You collected a paycheck.
That's a valid 2024.

Top Track: "Quietly Existing"

The B-sides are underrated anyway.
```

### The Cover Artist
**"You're Playing Someone Else's Song"**
```
You spent 2024 doing everyone
else's work, playing their parts,
covering their responsibilities.

Original work from you this year:
Unclear.

Top Track: "Not My Job (But Here I Am)"

Next year, write your own songs.
```

### The Underground Hit
**"You're Planning Your Breakout"**
```
You're currently unknown, but
you've been quietly working on
your exit strategy.

By 2025, you plan to be headlining
somewhere else entirely.

Top Track: "LinkedIn in My Browser Tabs"

The underground always goes mainstream eventually.
```

### The Album Leak
**"Everyone Knows You're Leaving"**
```
You haven't announced anything,
but everyone can tell.

Your engagement is minimal.
Your energy is elsewhere.
You're basically a leaked album -
officially unreleased but we all know.

Top Track: "Two Weeks Notice (Demo)"

The countdown is on.
```
