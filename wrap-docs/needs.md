# Work Wrap 2024 - Requirements Document

## Concept Overview

**What it is:** A satirical "Year in Review" for your work life, inspired by Spotify Wrapped but for corporate suffering.

**Tagline Ideas:**
- "Your Year in Work: The Trauma Edition"
- "2024 Wrapped... In Red Tape"
- "Your Work Year, Quantified (and Roasted)"

---

## Core Concept: Spotify Wrapped Parody

### The Hook
Just like Spotify tells you "You listened to Sad Songs 847 times this year," we tell people:
- "You were 'looped in' 247 times this year"
- "Your manager played you more than your top playlist"
- "You said 'sounds good' while feeling nothing 182 times"

### Why Year-End Timing is Perfect
- Everyone is sharing their Spotify Wrapped
- People are in reflective/nostalgic mood
- Maximum relatability for "surviving another year"
- Viral potential during December social media frenzy
- New Year's resolution energy ("this will be my year to quit")

---

## Feature Requirements

### 1. The "Wrapped" Experience Flow
Unlike the current quiz (answer questions → get result), this should feel like:
- **Story-based slides** (like Instagram/Spotify stories)
- **Reveal stats one by one** with dramatic flair
- **Build to a final "Work Persona" reveal**
- **Shareable stat cards** for each metric

### 2. "Stats" to Generate (Fake/Satirical)

#### Meeting Stats
- "Hours in meetings that could've been emails: 847"
- "Times someone said 'quick sync' (average duration: 47 min)"
- "Meetings where you contributed: 3"
- "Meetings where you were on mute doing other work: 291"

#### Communication Stats
- "Emails marked as 'urgent' that weren't: 156"
- "'Per my last email' energy level: Maximum"
- "Slack messages sent after 6pm: You don't want to know"
- "Times you typed a response, deleted it, and said nothing: 89"

#### Survival Stats
- "Coffee consumed: Enough to concern a cardiologist"
- "Sunday Scaries experienced: 52 (perfect score!)"
- "Times you Googled 'is it too late to change careers': 34"
- "LinkedIn sessions while pretending to work: 67"

#### Manager/Colleague Stats
- "Times your manager took credit for your work: More than Spotify plays"
- "Ideas stolen in meetings: 12"
- "Passive-aggressive emails received: 203"
- "Coworkers added to your mental block list: 7"

### 3. Persona Types (Year-End Edition)

| Persona | Description | Vibe |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **The Survivor** | "Made it through 2024. Barely." | Exhausted but alive |
| **The Quiet Quitter** | "Peaked in effort in March. Coasted ever since." | Efficient |
| **The LinkedIn Lurker** | "Applied to 47 jobs. Attended 0 interviews." | Planning escape |
| **The Corporate Athlete** | "Ran 12 marathons... of back-to-back meetings" | Overworked |
| **The Boundary Setter** | "Said 'no' 89 times. Felt alive." | Thriving |
| **The Meeting Martyr** | "8 hours of meetings, 0 hours of actual work" | Trapped |

### 4. Shareable Cards (Critical for Virality)

Each user should get **4-6 shareable "stat cards"** like:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     YOUR 2024 WORK WRAPPED      │
│                                 │
│  Your manager played you        │
│  more than Drake's new album    │
│                                 │
│  Times looped in: 247           │
│  Actual input needed: 3         │
│                                 │
│        workwrap.lol             │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5. Social Sharing Requirements

- Twitter/X card with stats

## Content Tone Requirements

### DO
- Lean into Spotify Wrapped visual language

- Reference 2024 specific events/trends
- Make it cathartic and validating
- Keep it LinkedIn-safe but spicy

### DON'T
- Be mean-spirited about specific people
- Reference company names
- Include anything that could get someone fired
- Make it feel like actual work

---

## Technical Considerations

### Animations
- Slide transitions (Spotify-style)
- Number count-up effects
- Confetti/celebration for absurd stats
- Fade-in text reveals

### Mobile-First
- Stories format works best on mobile
- Easy thumb navigation
- Share buttons prominent

### Performance
- Fast loading (meme potential = people sharing quickly)
- Preload assets for smooth transitions

---

## Success Metrics

- Shares per completion
- "Challenge sent" rate
- Return visitors (people comparing with friends)
- Time on site (should be quick but engaging)

---

## Launch Timing

**Ideal window:** December 1-15, 2024
- Coincides with Spotify Wrapped release
- Catches year-end reflection mood
- Before holiday vacation mode kicks in

---

## Competitive Advantage

Why this will work:
1. **Timeliness** - Wrapped parodies are peak December content
2. **Relatability** - Everyone had a work year to process
3. **Shareability** - Pre-formatted cards = easy sharing
4. **Catharsis** - Laughing at work pain = therapy
5. **FOMO** - "I need to see my stats too"
