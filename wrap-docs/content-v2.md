## Persona Results (Review Ratings)

### Rating: Exceeds Expectations
**"The Overachiever"**
```
FINAL REVIEW: Exceptional

Against all odds, you actually
thrived in 2024. Your goals were met.
Your metrics were up. Your manager
is mildly afraid of your ambition.

Recommended Action:
Keep it up. Or rest. You've earned it.

Review Status: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

### Rating: Meets Expectations
**"The Steady Performer"**
```
FINAL REVIEW: Satisfactory

You did your job. Not more, not less.
In a year where everything felt chaotic,
you maintained. That's not nothing.

Recommended Action:
Continue existing at current levels.

Review Status: ⭐⭐⭐☆☆
```

### Rating: Meets Expectations*
**"The Asterisk Employee"**
```
FINAL REVIEW: Meets Expectations*

*Technically

You were present. You attended meetings.
You turned things in. Whether any of it
was good is a question for Q1 2025.

Recommended Action:
Set clearer goals (and maybe follow them).

Review Status: ⭐⭐☆☆☆
```

### Rating: Needs Improvement
**"The Work In Progress"**
```
FINAL REVIEW: Developing

HR would call this "growth opportunity."
Reality would call this "barely hanging on."
You're not failing - you're just... existing
at a lower frequency than corporate wants.

Recommended Action:
Find a job that actually fits you.

Review Status: ⭐☆☆☆☆
```

### Rating: Under Review
**"The Question Mark"**
```
FINAL REVIEW: Inconclusive

Nobody quite knows what you do.
Including you. Including your manager.
Your role is a mystery. Your output is
theoretical. You are Schrodinger's employee.

Recommended Action:
Define... literally anything about your job.

Review Status: ⭐❓❓❓❓
```

### Rating: Performance Improvement Plan
**"The PIP Candidate"**
```
FINAL REVIEW: Concerning

You're one bad quarter away from
a "chat with HR." Your engagement
is visible from space (as absent).
The job has broken you or you've
broken from the job. Either way.

Recommended Action:
Polish that resume. You know why.

Review Status: ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

- Less memeable than music version
